### Introduction
Predicting the price of second-hand cars is not an easy task.
In recent times, there has been an increase in the demand
for used cars, making it essential to predict the price more
accurately due to consumer exploitation, which can happen
due to high demand. <br>
Predicting the price of a car includes various factors like
mileage, version, location, engine capacity, power steering,
and many more. Collating this information and buying the
perfect fit can take some time and even might not produce
fruitful results.
