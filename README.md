### Introduction
Predicting the price of second-hand cars is not an easy task.
In recent times, there has been an increase in the demand
for used cars, making it essential to predict the price more
accurately due to consumer exploitation, which can happen
due to high demand. <br>
Predicting the price of a car includes various factors like
mileage, version, location, engine capacity, power steering,
and many more. Collating this information and buying the
perfect fit can take some time and even might not produce
fruitful results.


### Description and Implementation Details
For this project, we have implemented various machine learning aglorithms on the dataset extracted from kaggle. We have used the following steps to reach to our conclusion - <br>

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - In this we first did feature selection, then we encoded the categorical features. Then we handled the null values by either dropping the rows containing the null values or by replacing null values by method of imputation. 
3. Methodology - For this we used various machine learning techniques that best suited our model. These include Linear Regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, KNN, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost.
